      <h2>Autobiography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Abodunrin Emmanuel Olatunde. I am a telecoms engineer with
        nearly half a decade experience in the telecoms industry. I hold a
        degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Lautech, completed
        in 2018. After graduating, I initially pursued a career in graphic
        design which I presume the easiest way to start a tech career. Tech has
        always been the goal but without a well structured learning path, I
        always hit the rock everytime I try self-learning. My journey has been
        driven by a deep passion for technology, which led me to explore various
        fields within the tech industry. It has been tough having a
        work-school-life balance as I Manage project that is time demanding and
        requires a lot of dedication.
